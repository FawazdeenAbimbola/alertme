#### Alertme
---
#### Description
Alertme is a web-app that helps to solve the problem of ingredients/products wastage due to the issue of not using a group of products/ingredients before their respective expiry dates. 

#### How to use
* Click the link below to start the Alertme Webapp.
* Add product name, product ID(how it can be easily identified or referenced), expiry date and click submit.

#### How it works
There are 5 rows: Product Name, Product ID, Expiry date, Status, Actions. The status can only display two outputs- Good or Expired. Under the Actions are two buttons- Edit and Delete. The "Edit" button is used to modify any changes in the field of the product while the "Delete" button is used to remove a particular product.
After the product details(Name, ID, Expiry date) have been successfully added, it starts to calculates the difference between the current date it was submitted and the Expiry date.Once it is 3 days to the expiry date and the product have not been used, it sends a notification/alert to be used.
